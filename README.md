# Product Experience 

To showcase what I can bring to an organization I've taken the time to link to some product work I've completed in the past.

## VA.gov - Authenticated Experience - Profile 

While working on this contract vehicle, I was fortunate to collaborate with an excellent team of engineers and designer/researchers to build several features and products to better support the user experience on VA.gov. We were focused on users post authentication and specifically my team worked on the user Profile and how best to do a few things: 

  1. We wanted to integrate to additional internal VA Systems in order to surface key pieces of information important to veterans
       -  This comprised the bulk of our work, we maintained a lot of connections to a slew of API's to ensure a consistent and stable experience.  
  2. We were focused on enhancing the accessibility of [our product portfolio](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a4c22fdc7963b2b03b6b0b292a80b7c828d116fb/products/identity-personalization/profile/README.md)
  3. We wanted to integrate with other VA.gov products to create better experiences so we could surface relevant information when needed (eg. when applying for benefits)

### Examples of projects

Below Iâ€™ve linked to product documentation (markdown pages or GitHub Epics) or other artifacts to showcase some of the workshops I'm capable of leading. For the GitHub markdown pages, the links below are permalinks and will open the pages at the point in time when I left the project.

- [Profile Hub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a4c22fdc7963b2b03b6b0b292a80b7c828d116fb/products/identity-personalization/profile/hub/README.md)
     - Faced with an intractable accessibility issue, we built a new landing page for the profile
- [Editing-as-a-subtask](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a4c22fdc7963b2b03b6b0b292a80b7c828d116fb/products/identity-personalization/profile/editing-as-a-subtask/README.md)
     - We enhanced the process flow for updating pieces of contact information while keeping users in context
- [Expanding Military Information - ILER IES](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/a4c22fdc7963b2b03b6b0b292a80b7c828d116fb/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/2024-ies/README.md)
     - Congress has mandated the VA grant Veterans access to their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Records. This work was some of the most complex work from a backend perspective requiring complex systems integration work.

- [Chapter 33 Edu Benefits - Direct Deposit Migration](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/a4c22fdc7963b2b03b6b0b292a80b7c828d116fb/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/ch33-bdn-corpdb-migration)
     - The system supporting Chapter 33 direct deposits was deprecated and replaced with a modern database with more robust security. We were given just over 60 days to disconnect from the old database and reconnect to a new set of API's integrated with the new database. This was time sensitive and highly impactful for thousands of users. Before the migration we saw roughly 5,000 updates daily to direct deposit accounts. 
- [Contact Info Page Revisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/89505)
     - We discovered while analyzing user data a series of trends related to undeliverable mail. This work was strongly driven by the data quality issues we were seeing
